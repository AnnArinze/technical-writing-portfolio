ADR 001: Migrate from REST API to GraphQL
Status
Accepted

Context
Our current backend API is built using RESTful principles. However, we have been facing the following issues:

Over-fetching and Under-fetching: Clients often receive more data than needed or lack some required data, necessitating additional requests.
Poorly Defined Endpoints: Over time, the number of endpoints has increased, and their responsibilities have become unclear, leading to a high maintenance burden.
Difficult Client Integration: As more front-end clients (e.g., web, mobile) are introduced, it has become increasingly challenging to support their specific needs without significant backend changes.
Decision
We will migrate our backend API from REST to GraphQL.

Reasons
Efficiency: GraphQL allows clients to request exactly what they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.
Single Endpoint: With GraphQL, all data queries are served from a single endpoint, which simplifies backend maintenance.
Flexibility: Front-end developers can specify the structure of the response, which provides greater flexibility and decouples the backend from the frontend.
Alternatives Considered
Continue with REST API and Optimize Endpoints: This would require significant changes to existing endpoints and does not entirely solve the problem of over-fetching or under-fetching.
Use gRPC: While gRPC offers benefits like performance and type-safety, it is not well-suited for web applications and requires more effort to integrate with our existing ecosystem.
Consequences
Pros:

Simplified data fetching for clients.
Less code duplication and easier maintainability.
Improved client and server decoupling.
Cons:

Initial learning curve for developers unfamiliar with GraphQL.
Refactoring effort required to migrate existing REST endpoints.
Potential performance considerations (N+1 query problem) that need to be handled properly.
Mitigation Plan
Provide internal training and documentation for GraphQL.
Use tools like Apollo Server and DataLoader to address potential performance issues.
Incrementally migrate endpoints to GraphQL, starting with less complex and high-value endpoints.
